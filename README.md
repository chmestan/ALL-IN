### What is the concept?

Arena is a top-down 2D shoot 'em up / bullet hell game inspired by _UFO 50's Overbold_, _The Binding of Isaac_ and _Enter The Gungeon_.
In each level, the player will have several waves of enemies to face in a small arena. In between these waves, they'll be rewarded with money that they can use in the shop.

The shop mode includes:
* Upgrades of several categories that can be purchased ;
* The possibility to add enemies to the next wave in exchange for a higher monetary reward upon completion.

The game also includes roguelite elements as :
* The enemies of each wave are randomly chosen (while still respecting a certain difficuly curve)
* Permanent upgrades can be purchased in between runs (to be added in a much later version).
