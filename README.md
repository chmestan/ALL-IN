### What is the concept?

*All In* is a top-down 2D shoot 'em up / bullet hell game inspired by _UFO 50's Overbold_, _The Binding of Isaac_ and _Enter The Gungeon_.
In each level, the player will have several waves of enemies to face in a small arena. In between these waves, they'll be rewarded with money that they can use in the shop.
The shop mode includes:
* Upgrades of several categories that can be purchased ;
* The possibility to add enemies to the next wave in exchange for a higher monetary reward upon completion.
